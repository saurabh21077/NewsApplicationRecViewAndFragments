Assignment 3 - News Application

Summary:
A news application that lists news and shows details of the news. This assignment builds upon
assignment 2 where you started a service to download the images and you showed the title of
recent news only. Now you need to show all the news in a list detail format. The list will show the
news number and the details will show the details of the news. The details part will show the
body (news description) and an image along with the Title. Use RecyclerView to show the list of
news. The list and details both should use Fragments. One should be able to put a comment on
a news article.
